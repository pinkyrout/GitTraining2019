Description of Git Commands

1. git -revert : is used for undoing the last commit on the git by inverting the changes and adding a new commit to it.

2. git -rebase : is used to merge the commits of the branch with the master branch such that it appears to be in linear approach rather than in a tree like approach.

3. git reset --hard : is used to change the status of files to the status of changes to be committed, ie. in the staging area.

4. git reset --soft : is used to discard any changes to the tracked files because all the commits from the beginning are discarded.

5. git commit --amend : is used to correct the git comment for any specific commit operation.

6. git cherry-pick : allows picking a commit from one branch to another, in case a push has been done on an incorrect branch.

7. git cherry-pick with range : allows picking a commit from one branch to another in a given range of commit id.


git config --global : global here refers to the global operating system user and writes to ~/.gitconfig file, unlike the local option which is restricted to the local .git/config repository.

rebase vs merge : rebase linearizes the tree structure by changing the base of the branch whereas merging integrates the features of the branch with the master.
	Also, merge saves the history of commit whereas rebase rewrites it.
